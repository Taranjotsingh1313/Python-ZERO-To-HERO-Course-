# TYPES OF OPERATORS:
# Arithmetic operators
# Assignment operators
# Comparison operators
# Logical operators

# ARITHMETICS
# +,-,*,/,%
# 1) + :- ADDITION
# a = 5
# b = 2
# print(a + b)
# print("HELLO, MY NAME IS " + "SIMAR")
#2) - :- SUBTRACTION
# print(a - b)

#3) * :- MULTIPLICATION
# print(a * b)
# 4) / :- DIVIDE
# print(a/b)

#5) % :- MODULUS :- returns the remainder
# print(b %a )

# ASSIGNMENT OPERATORS
# =,-=,+=,*=,/=
# 1) = USED TO ASSIGN VALUE
# a = 5
# b = 6
# print(a,b)
# 2) -= 
# a -= 5 :- a = a - 5



a = 8
# a -= 5 :- a = a - 5
# print(a)
# 3) += 
# a += 5 :- a = a + 5
#  print(a)
# 4) *=
# a *=2  :- a = a * 2
# a *= 2
# print(a)
# 5)
# a /= 2 :- a = a / 2
# a /= 2
# print(a)

# COMPARISM OPERATORS
# == , != , < ,>,<=,>=
# == :- for checking two values and type are equal or not
a = 1
b = 5
# print(a == b)

# !=  :- not equal to
# print(a != b)

# < :- less than
# print(a < b)

# > :- greater than
# print(b > a)

# <= :- less than equal to
# print(a <= b)

# >= :- greater than equal to
# print(a >= b)

# LOGICAL OPERATORS 
# AND : -return true if both conditiions are true
# OR : - return true if one of the condition is true

a = 5
b = 6
# print(a == 6 and b == 6)
# print(a == 6 or b == 6)
